# Homebrew cask for Curio — the unsigned macOS distribution channel.
#
# The app is neither signed nor notarized (Apple Developer enrollment is
# skipped by decision), so this ships the unsigned .app from the GitHub
# release and documents the Gatekeeper right-click-open path in `caveats`.
# Source of truth: alexnodeland/curio-rss → dist/homebrew/Casks/curio.rb.
cask "curio" do
  # Unsigned + always-latest: the tap always installs whatever the latest
  # GitHub release published, so there is no per-release sha256 to bump. One
  # universal DMG (arm64 + x64) — matches the tap's other casks and avoids the
  # scarce Intel CI runner.

  caveats <<~EOS
    Curio is NOT signed or notarized (Apple Developer enrollment is skipped),
    so macOS Gatekeeper will refuse to open it on first launch. To run it:

      1. In Finder, open /Applications and right-click (Control-click) Curio.app
      2. Choose "Open", then "Open" again in the warning dialog

    or clear the quarantine flag from a terminal:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Curio.app"

    You only need to do this once per install.
